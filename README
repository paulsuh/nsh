nsh//network config shell//Chris Cappuccio <chris@nmedia.net> version 1.0

NSH is a CLI intended for OpenBSD-based network appliances. It replaces
ifconfig, sysctl and route with its own simple command language, and
encapsulates configuration for other daemons into one place, effectively
replacing /etc/netstart and parts of /etc/rc for appliance-style usage.

Daemons and services encapsulated by nsh:

pf, ospfd, ospf6d, bgpd, ripd, ldpd, relayd, ipsecctl, iked, rtadvd,
dvmrpd, sasyncd, dhcpd, snmpd, sshd, ntpd, ifstated, tftp-proxy, ftp-proxy,
tftpd, npppd, resolv.conf, inetd, smtpd, ldapd, ifstated

NSH is freely licensed, in the BSD style.

In conjunction with the OpenBSD kernel and the daemons you wish to control,
you have a fully functioning system.

See MANUAL for installation instructons and command set.

See TODO for details on implementation status and future ideas.

See http://github.com/yellowman/nsh/ for current source code repository and
